       "'Another auction is here, and RCB steps in with the same hopeâ€”to build a well-rounded team capable of clinching their first-ever IPL title. It has been 17 long years, and the Royal Challengers Bangaloreâ€™s quest for the coveted trophy continues. With renewed energy and optimism, RCB must craft a better strategy, as the foundation for winning an IPL trophy is often laid at the auction table. Time and again, the franchiseâ€™s loyal fans and supporters have been left disappointed by questionable decisions and picks during previous auctions. This time, the focus will be on avoiding past mistakes and assembling a balanced squad for IPL 2025. The first step towards this goal was evident in the retentions announced during the IPL 2025 retention window.\\n\\nadvertisement\\n\\nRCB splurged Rs 37 crore to retain three players, with Virat Kohli being their top retention for RS 21 crore. Rajat Patidar followed at Rs 11 crore, while Yash Dayal, retained under the uncapped player category, was valued at Rs 4 crore. These retentions signal a strategic shift for RCB, moving away from an over-reliance on star power to strengthening their Indian coreâ€”a proven formula for success in IPL history. Kohli extended his long-standing association with the franchise, becoming the most expensive Indian retention this season.\\n\\nPatidar was rewarded for his consistent performances, cementing his place in the teamâ€™s plans. With Rs 83 crore left in their purse and three RTMs available for both capped and uncapped players, RCB is poised to make crucial moves at the IPL 2025 mega auction. This will be their stepping stone toward building a squad capable of finally ending their title drought.\\n\\nRCB: List of retained players\\n\\nA\\nMust Read\\nAR Rahman uses hashtag on divorce post. Internet is puzzled\\n\\nTRENDING TOPICS:\\nElections 2024\\nBorder-Gavaskar Trophy\\nDelhi AQI\\nIndia-China LAC Deal\\nMiddle East Crisis\\nVirat Kohli - Rs 21 crore\\n\\nRajat Patidar - Rs 11 crore\\n\\nYash Dayal - Rs 4 crore\\n\\nWho Can RCB retain using RTM?\\nMohammed Siraj\\n\\nThe top candidate on RCBâ€™s radar for using the Right to Match (RTM) option is Mohammed Siraj. A key bowler for the franchise since 2018, Sirajâ€™s release came as a surprise to many. Over his tenure, he has taken 83 wickets in 87 IPL matches, making him the third-highest wicket-taker for RCB. Retained for Rs 7 crore ahead of the IPL 2022 mega auction, Siraj continued to perform consistently, claiming 15 wickets in the last season. His omission from the retention list was unexpected, but RCB might look to bring him back using the RTM option, recognising his impact on the teamâ€™s bowling unit.\\n\\nGlenn Maxwell\\n\\nAustralian all-rounder Glenn Maxwell has been a pivotal player for RCB in recent seasons. Known for his explosive batting, sharp fielding, and handy off-spin, Maxwell adds versatility to the side. Purchased for Rs 14.25 crore in the IPL 2025 mega auction, Maxwellâ€™s association with RCB has been fruitful despite a disappointing IPL 2024 with the bat. The franchise values his contributions during the three strong seasons prior to IPL 2024, which could motivate them to use RTM to secure his services again. Maxwell himself has spoken warmly about his discussions with the RCB management after his release, indicating mutual respect and potential for reunion.'"
